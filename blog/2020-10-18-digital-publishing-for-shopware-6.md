Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The first blog post here is to announce the launch of the first stable (read 'stable enough') version of my Advanced Banners (a.k.a Digital Publishing) plugin for Shopware 6.
It's available for free on [Github](https://github.com/runelaenen/shopware6-advanced-banners) & [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/runelaenen/shopware6-advanced-banners).

Install and try it out yourself:
```
composer require runelaenen/shopware6-advanced-banners
```

Using Advanced banners, you can create layered, responsive banners without the need of technical knowledge or software like Photoshop. The plugin allows you to create content made out of layers of images, text, buttons, ... from within the Shopware 6 backend.

The plugin is heavily inspired by the Shopware 5 Digital Publishing plugin.

## Features
- Banner editor
- Layered banners
- Image, text, wysiwyg layers
- Easily extendible
- 'Advanced Banner' CMS element
- 'Advanced Banner Slider' CMS element

> Are you using and liking this plugin? Make sure to give a star on [Github](https://github.com/runelaenen/shopware6-advanced-banners) and consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/runelaenen) or [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/runelaenen) so I can keep justifying putting a lot of time in these free open source plugins.
