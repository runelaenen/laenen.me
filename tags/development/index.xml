      <description>Shopware is very extendable, but not everything is as easy to do or is as well documented as we would sometimes like. To extend this online &amp;lsquo;community-documentation&amp;rsquo;, I like to write down some tips, tricks and code snippets and share them with the world. Today, I tried to add a custom icon to the Shopware 6 Administration, and found out that it was not very easy to do. Until you know how, of course!</description>
